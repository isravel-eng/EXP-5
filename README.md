## THEORY
A **Zener diode** is a heavily doped p–n junction diode designed to operate in the **reverse breakdown region**.  
When reverse biased, the diode does not conduct until the applied voltage reaches the **breakdown voltage (Vz)**. Beyond this point, the diode conducts heavily while maintaining an **almost constant voltage** across it.

To prevent excessive current and damage, a **series resistor** is used.  
Due to its **low dynamic resistance**, the Zener diode is widely used as a **voltage regulator**.

---

## PROCEDURE

1. Make connections as per the circuit diagram.  
2. Switch ON the regulated power supply and increase the voltage in steps.  
3. Observe that the Zener voltage (Vz) remains nearly constant while Zener current (Iz) increases.  
4. Note the readings of **Vz** and **Iz** in the observation table.  
5. Plot a graph of **Iz (Y-axis)** versus **Vz (X-axis)**.

## V–I & REGULATION CHARACTERISTICS
- Zener diode shows sharp breakdown at Vz  
- Voltage remains constant despite current variation

---

## PRECAUTIONS

1. Do not exceed the Zener diode power rating.  
2. Ensure correct polarity of voltmeter and ammeter.  
3. Verify circuit connections before switching ON the power supply.

## RESULT
The **Zener diode breakdown characteristics** and **voltage regulation behavior** were successfully observed and verified.
